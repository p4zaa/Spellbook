    Run one Independent Cascade (IC) simulation and return the set of activated nodes 
    and per-step activations.

    The Independent Cascade model simulates how information or influence spreads through
    a network. Each activated node has one chance to activate its inactive neighbors
    based on edge probabilities. The process continues until no new activations occur
    or the maximum number of steps is reached.

    Parameters:
        G: NetworkX directed graph with edge attributes containing activation probabilities
        seeds (Set[Any]): Set of seed nodes to start the cascade from
        max_steps (int, optional): Maximum number of simulation steps. Defaults to 99999.
        prob_attr (str, optional): Name of edge attribute containing activation probabilities. Defaults to 'weight'.
        default_prob (float, optional): Default probability to use for edges without probability attribute. Defaults to 0.1.

    Returns:
        Tuple[Set[Any], List[Set[Any]]]: A tuple containing:
            - Set of all activated nodes at the end of simulation
            - List of sets, where each set contains the cumulative activated nodes at each step

    Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF) algorithm for influence maximization.
    
    CELF is an efficient greedy algorithm to select the k most influential nodes in a network
    under the Independent Cascade (IC) model. It improves computational efficiency compared 
    to naive greedy by using lazy evaluations of marginal gains.

    Parameters:
        G: NetworkX directed graph
            Graph where edges represent influence links and may contain activation probabilities
            as attributes (e.g., 'weight').
        k (int):
            Number of seed nodes to select.
        prob_attr (str, optional):
            Name of the edge attribute storing activation probabilities. Defaults to 'weight'.
        default_prob (float, optional):
            Default probability used for edges without the probability attribute. Must be between 0 and 1.
            Defaults to 0.1.
        mc (int, optional):
            Number of Monte Carlo simulations per marginal gain estimation. Higher values give more
            accurate expected spread estimates but increase runtime. Defaults to 100.
        **kwargs:
            Additional arguments passed to `independent_cascade` (e.g., `max_steps`).

    Returns:
        List[Any]:
            List of k seed nodes that maximize expected influence spread.
